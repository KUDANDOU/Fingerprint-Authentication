# Fingerprint-Authentication
#STUDENT EXAM IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

##GENERAL USE OF THE STUDENT EXAM IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
Final HIT 200 project of developing a student exam identification and authentication sytem using fingerprint based technology
All students at universities and institutions write examinations and before sitting for those exams a number of activities are excised inorder to qualify one for an exam.The issue of identification, verification, authentication and attendance registration in present-day institutions is really posing a great challenge in academic setting, because of the way the process is done and various hurdles surrounding it.A fingerprint based examination authentication system. The system will be designed to pass only users verified by their fingerprint scan and block non-verified users. The system will consist of two main processes for authentication, these includes identification and verification. In verification, the system compares an input fingerprint to the “enrolled” fingerprint of a specific user to determine if they are from the same finger. In identification, the system compares an input fingerprint with the prints of all enrolled users in the database to determine if the person is already known under a duplicate or false identity. After identification then the student then enters the exam room and also attendance is automatically marked.Therefore this system will be used to:
-add more security measures to the examination processes using finger print biometrics.
-eliminate the possibility of an imposter appearing in an exam

#Hardware 
computers
fingerprint scanner with a usb cable

#installation
the system can be installed on any laptop device. 
there are no complicated installation procedures involved but just to accept all on the installation prompt then application installs.

**Procedure for running the system*
*for administrator*
1.install the application
2.install drivers for the scanner, first make sure there are no other drivers installed 
3.connect the fingerprint scanner device to your laptop
4.Log in to system using the correct hard coded username and password (select login as admin)
5.the menu form opens and the admin can enroll lectures and imvigilators into the system and has the privilegde to perform all other operations

*for registra *
1.install the application
2.install drivers for the scanner, first make sure there are no other drivers installed 
3.connect the fingerprint scanner device to your laptop
4.Log in to system using the correct hard coded username and password (select login as registra)
5.the menu form opens and the registra can register students for different courses saving their details and then updating the fingerprint using a specific id.

*for invigilator*
1.install the application
2.install drivers for the scanner, first make sure there are no other drivers installed 
3.connect the fingerprint scanner device to your laptop
4.Log in to system using the correct hard coded username and password (select login as registra)
5.the menu form opens and the invigilator can use the attendence form to validate students into the exam ...scans the student fingerprint using the connected scanner
